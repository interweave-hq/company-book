# Analytics Tool

<Callout>
  **Decision**: We chose [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com). Our prior experience with the tool, its generous free tier,
  and the power of what it can do won us over. While the A/B support is not excellent, its possible and there are other
  integrations we can use to make it better.

We need a way to track stuff. Examining our [growth strategy](/growth-strategy), we need to analyze our funnels and measure our successes or failures over time. We'll have to experiment and see how those experiments play out.

Two major things I want to track:

1. Page traffic
2. User events

Ideally this is coupled together in the same tool, but we may have to find something else.
