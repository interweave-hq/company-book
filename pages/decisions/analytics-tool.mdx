# Analytics Tool

We need a way to track stuff. Examining our [growth strategy](/growth-strategy), we need to analyze our funnels and measure our successes or failures over time. We'll have to experiment and see how those experiments play out.

Two major things I want to track:

1. Page traffic
2. User events

Ideally this is coupled together in the same tool, but we may have to find something else.
