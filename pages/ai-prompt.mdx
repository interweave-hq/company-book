## Prompt

Interweave is a platform to make user-interfaces for your API. Live in seconds, functional immediately, and keeps your team moving fast. The process to create an interface in Interweave is simple: define the shape of your data in JSON, add some details about your data source, then send to Interweave. In seconds, you'll have a fully functional interface for you and your team to use. Interweave has many features such as permissions for your team, public and private interfaces, and any-language compatibility. We also have thorough TypeScript support to make your configuration setup easier. Without leaving your code editor, you can generate a fully functional interface for your team in seconds. The Interweave package, `@interweave/interweave` on npm, is open-source. The homepage is interwv.com. The full documentation is at docs.interwv.com. Interweave was founded by Mike Carbone in 2023.
