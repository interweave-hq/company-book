# Marketing Language

Maintaining a cohesive marketing language is important. **A brand is a promise**, and we need to make sure our promise is consistent. Consistency also increases chances memorability, so sticking with the same language is very important.

Let's get started by answering a few questions:

What is Interweave?

> Interweave is a platform to make user-interfaces for your API. Live in seconds, functional immediately, and keeps your team moving fast.

Now say it again three more times:

> Interweave is a platform to make user-interfaces for your API. Live in seconds, functional immediately, and keeps your team moving fast.

> Interweave is a platform to make user-interfaces for your API. Live in seconds, functional immediately, and keeps your team moving fast.

> Interweave is a platform to make user-interfaces for your API. Live in seconds, functional immediately, and keeps your team moving fast.

The most important part is using the same key phrases:

- User-interfaces for your API
- Functional immediately
- Live in seconds
- Keeps your team moving fast
